# WEATHER-API

This project is a weather app built through the use of weather APIs making requests to the open weather service. 
When the user loads up the app, the user is met with a search bar where they can type in any city they choose. 
Once they hit eneter, data will be loaded for the current day's forecast, along with the 5 day weather forecast 
below the current stats. As an added bonus, on the left side where the search bar is, each city that the user 
searches for is saved in a list that can be revisited upon clicking the desired city.
